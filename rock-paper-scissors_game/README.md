A classic interactive game built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates dynamic DOM updates, randomized logic, and state management.

    2. Randomized AI: The computer choice is generated using the Math.random() function to ensure a fair and unpredictable game.

    3. Responsive Design: Styled with CSS to ensure the game looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

    4. Interactive UI: Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback to the user, similar to the gallery items in my other projects.
